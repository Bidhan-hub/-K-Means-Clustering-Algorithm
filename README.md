# -K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm
Clustering analysis of Age and Income data using KMeans with feature scaling and the Elbow method for optimal cluster selection.
This project demonstrates clustering analysis on an Age and Income dataset using Python. The dataset contains three columns: Name, Age, and Income. The primary goal of the project is to segment the data into meaningful clusters based on Age and Income. The project begins with data visualization using scatter plots to understand the distribution and potential groupings. Since the Name column is non-numeric, it is excluded from clustering. Initially, KMeans clustering is applied with three clusters, and the resulting clusters are visualized. To address differences in feature scales, MinMaxScaler is used to normalize the Age and Income values, followed by re-clustering and plotting the scaled clusters along with their centroids.

Additionally, the project implements the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters. By computing the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) for k values ranging from 1 to 9, an elbow plot is generated to visually identify the point where increasing the number of clusters yields diminishing returns in error reduction. This provides a systematic approach to selecting the ideal cluster count for KMeans. Overall, the project illustrates essential clustering techniques, feature scaling, centroid visualization, and model evaluation using the Elbow method, making it a comprehensive example for data segmentation and unsupervised learning.
